//JavaScript is a functional language, and for object oriented programming it uses both objects and functions, but objects are usually used as a data structure, similar to a dictionary in Python or a map in Java.

//(To initialize an object, use curly braces)

let personObject = {
    firstName: "Paula",
    lastName: "Suarez"
}

//Member addressing
//Members of objects can be addressed using the brackets operator [], very much like arrays, but just like many other object oriented languages, the period . operator can also be used.

personObject.age = 42;
personObject["salary"] = 10000000000;

//Iteration
//Use the hasOwnProperty method to check that the member in fact belongs to the object.


for (let member in personObject) {
    if (personObject.hasOwnProperty(member)) {
        console.log("the member " + member + " of personObject is " + personObject[member])

    let value = entry[1];

    console.log(key);
    console.log(value);
    //use key and value here
});
